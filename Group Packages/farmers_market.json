The enormously popular market attracts residents from the Borough and surrounding communities who come to buy fresh, healthy, local food. In 2008, the Stonington Farmers Market became a year-round event on Saturdays, moving inside during the winter months.\n\n \n\nItems sold at the market include locally grown vegetables and fruits, jams, a variety of breads, pies and baked goods, cheese, eggs, poultry, meat, seafood, Italian ices, maple syrup, honey, and flowers. Thanks to greenhouses, our farmers are able to offer a selection of fresh produce throughout the winter. Our market offers whatever our farmers are harvesting each week as well as prepared foods such as salsa, soups, meat pies, hummus, breakfast sandwiches, and baked goods.\n\n\nIn addition to great food, different craft vendors are featured each week at the market. Among the hand-made items you will find are beautiful candles, pottery, jewelry, wooden bowls, cutting boards, soaps, gorgeous note cards, and table linens.",

Staffing consisted of a dedicated Food and Nutrition Coordinator and a team of VISTA Volunteers afforded to the Project by the University of Connecticut's Agricultural Department. The Market opened with some fifteen vendors selling produce, baked goods and craft items. All vendors had been vetted by farm and site visits to certify that all items sold were originally produced by the respective vendors, that their farm or place of business was local, and that they were in compliance with all applicable regulations of the State and local Department of Public Health, the State's Department of Agriculture, and other regulatory bodies. Federal Food Stamp certification was also obtained.",
